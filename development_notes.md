## 1. SET UP THE CHESS BOARD AND PIECES

In this step, we will set up the chess board and pieces. We will break this task into these substeps:

1. **Implement and test the Board class.**
   - The Board class will be responsible for generating and maintaining the board state. It will hold the information about the positions of all pieces on the board and provide methods to update the board after each move.
   - The Board class should have a method to initialize the board, creating an 8x8 grid.
   - It should store references to all active pieces on the board
   - It should also include methods to add, remove, and move pieces on the board.
   - To check if a move is valid, there should be a method to determine if a given position is within the bounds of the board.
2. **Implement and test the Piece class and its subclasses.**
   - The Piece class will be the base class for all chess pieces. It will define common attributes such as color and position.
   - Create subclasses for each type of piece: Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King. These subclasses will inherit from the Piece class.
   - Each subclass should have a method to determine its valid moves. This method will vary depending on the specific movement rules for each piece type.
3. **Test placing pieces in their initial positions on the board.**
   - Instantiate pieces for both players in their respective initial positions.
   - Place the pieces on the board using the Board class methods.
   - Ensure that the pieces are placed correctly on the board, and the board state is accurately represented.

### 1.1. Implement and test the Board class

The Board class will be responsible for managing the chess board's state, including the positions of all active pieces.

Here's a high-level overview of what the Board class should include:

1. Initialize the board:
   - Create a method to initialize the board with an 8x8 grid. This can be represented using a two-dimensional array, where each cell corresponds to a square on the chess board.

2. Manage active pieces:
   - Add a data structure (e.g., an array or a hash) to store references to all active pieces on the board. This will help with move validation, game state evaluation, and special move implementation.
   - Create methods to add and remove pieces from the active pieces data structure when needed.

3. Add, move, and remove pieces on the board:
   - Implement methods to add a piece to a specific position on the board, move a piece from one position to another, and remove a piece from the board.
   - Ensure that these methods update both the board's grid and the active pieces data structure as needed.

4. Validate positions:
   - Create a method to check if a given position is within the bounds of the chess board. This will be useful for move validation and determining valid moves for each piece.

5. Access pieces and their positions:
   - Implement methods to retrieve a piece at a specific position, get the position of a piece, or find all pieces of a specific type or color.

When testing the Board class, consider the following:

- Test the board initialization method to ensure it creates an 8x8 grid.
- Test adding and removing pieces from the active pieces data structure.
- Test adding, moving, and removing pieces on the board, making sure the board's grid and the active pieces data structure are updated correctly.
- Test the position validation method to ensure it correctly identifies valid and invalid positions on the board.
- Test methods that access pieces and their positions to ensure they return the correct information.

By thoroughly implementing and testing the Board class, you'll establish a strong foundation for managing the game state throughout the development process.

### 1.2. Implement and test the Piece class and its subclasses

In step 1.2, you'll implement and test the Piece class and its subclasses. The Piece class serves as the base class for all chess pieces, while the subclasses represent each specific type of piece (Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King).

Here's a high-level overview of the Piece class and its subclasses:

1. Implement the Piece class:
   - Define common attributes for all chess pieces, such as color (white or black) and position (row and column on the board).
   - Implement a method to check if a piece has the same color as another piece. This will be useful when validating moves.
   - Define an abstract method to calculate valid moves for each piece. This method will be implemented by each subclass according to the piece's specific movement rules.

2. Implement the subclasses for each type of piece:
   - Create subclasses for Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, and King, inheriting from the Piece class.
   - For each subclass, implement the method to calculate valid moves, taking into account the piece's unique movement rules. This method should return a list of valid destination positions for the piece, given its current position on the board.
   - Consider any special movement conditions for each piece type, such as the Pawn's initial double-move option or capturing via en passant.

3. Test the Piece class and its subclasses:
   - Test the initialization of the Piece class and each subclass, ensuring that the correct attributes are set (e.g., color and position).
   - Test the method to check if a piece has the same color as another piece.
   - Test the valid move calculation method for each subclass, ensuring that the correct destination positions are returned based on the piece's movement rules.

When testing the Piece class and its subclasses, consider the following for each piece type:

- Moves near the board edges
- Moves that involve capturing other pieces
- Moves that are blocked by other pieces.

By thoroughly implementing and testing each piece type, you'll ensure that the game follows the standard chess rules and that each piece moves correctly on the board.

Here's a high-level overview of what this step involves:

1. Instantiate pieces for both players:
   - Create instances of each type of piece for both white and black players. There should be 16 pieces per player, including 8 Pawns, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops, 1 Queen, and 1 King.
   - Set the appropriate color and initial position for each piece.

2. Place the pieces on the board:
   - Use the Board class methods (e.g., `add_piece`) to place each piece on the board according to the standard chess starting position.
   - Ensure that the pieces are added to the active pieces data structure in the Board class.

3. Test the initial board state:
   - Verify that the board's grid and the active pieces data structure correctly represent the initial position of all the pieces.
   - Check that the Piece instances have the correct color and position attributes.
   - Confirm that the board displays the correct arrangement of pieces in the terminal.

When testing this step, make sure to consider the following:

- Ensure that each player's pieces are placed on the correct ranks (rows). White pieces should be placed on ranks 1 and 2, while black pieces should be placed on ranks 7 and 8.
- Confirm that the pieces are ordered correctly on the board, with Pawns in the front rank and the other pieces (Rooks, Knights, Bishops, Queen, and King) in the back rank.
- Test edge cases by placing pieces in various positions on the board to ensure that the add_piece method works correctly.

By thoroughly testing the placement of pieces in their initial positions on the board, you'll ensure that the game starts with the correct setup, setting the stage for a smooth gameplay experience.

1. Implement and test castling rules for the King and Rook pieces:
   - Implement castling move validation for the King and Rook pieces in their respective subclasses.
   - Ensure that castling is only allowed under the correct conditions (e.g., neither piece has moved, no pieces are between them, and the King isn't in check or passing through attacked squares).
   - Test castling for both kingside and queenside, and for both white and black players.

2. Implement and test en passant rules for Pawns:
   - Implement en passant move validation for Pawn pieces in the Pawn subclass.
   - Ensure that en passant is only allowed under the correct conditions (e.g., a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn, which can then capture it as if it had moved only one square forward).
   - Test en passant captures for both white and black players.

3. Imlement and test pawn promotion rules:
   - Implement pawn promotion move validation for Pawn pieces in the Pawn subclass.
   - Ensure that pawn promotion occurs when a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank (8th rank for white, 1st rank for black) and allows the player to choose a new piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight) to replace the pawn.
   - Test pawn promotion for both white and black players, and for each promotion choice.

1. Implement castling move validation for the King and Rook pieces:
   - In the King and Rook subclasses, create methods to check if castling is a valid move for the respective pieces.
   - Ensure that the methods consider the correct castling conditions for both kingside and queenside castling.

2. Ensure correct castling conditions are met:
   - Neither the King nor the Rook involved in castling should have moved before.
   - There should be no pieces between the King and the Rook involved in castling.
   - The King should not be in check, nor should the squares it moves through or to be attacked by an enemy piece.

3. Update the Board class to handle castling:
   - Modify the Board class to recognize castling moves and update the positions of both the King and the Rook involved in castling.
   - Ensure that the board's state is updated correctly after a castling move.

4. Test castling:
   - Test castling for both white and black players.
   - Test both kingside and queenside castling.
   - Test scenarios where castling is not allowed, such as when the King or Rook has already moved, there are pieces between them, or the King is in check or moving through an attacked square.

By implementing and testing castling rules for the King and Rook pieces, you'll ensure that this special move is correctly integrated into the game and follows standard chess rules. This will help create an accurate and enjoyable gameplay experience.

### 2.2. Test en passant rules for Pawns

En passant is a special capture move in chess that occurs only between pawns. It allows a pawn to capture an opponent's pawn that has just moved two squares forward from its starting position, bypassing the square where it would have landed if it had moved only one square forward.

Here's a high-level overview of what this sub-step entails:

1. Implement en passant move validation for Pawns:
   - In the Pawn subclass, create a method to check if en passant is a valid capture move for the pawn.
   - Ensure that the method considers the correct en passant conditions, such as the opponent's pawn moving two squares forward and landing beside the capturing pawn.

2. Ensure correct en passant conditions are met:
   - The capturing pawn must be on its fifth rank (for white) or fourth rank (for black).
   - The opponent's pawn must have just moved two squares forward from its starting position and landed beside the capturing pawn.
   - The capture must be made on the very next move after the opponent's pawn's double-step move.

3. Update the Board class to handle en passant:
   - Modify the Board class to recognize en passant capture moves and update the positions of both the capturing pawn and the captured pawn.
   - Ensure that the board's state is updated correctly after an en passant capture, removing the captured pawn from the board.

4. Test en passant captures:
   - Test en passant captures for both white and black players.
   - Test scenarios where en passant captures are allowed and when they are not allowed.
   - Test cases where the en passant capture opportunity is missed (i.e., the player does not capture on the very next move after the opponent's pawn's double-step move).

By implementing and testing en passant rules for Pawns, you'll ensure that this special capture move is correctly integrated into the game and follows standard chess rules. This will contribute to a more accurate and engaging gameplay experience.

```ruby
def possible_moves(board)
  moves = []

  moves.concat(move_generator(board, 1, 1, 0))
  # ... other move generators ...

  moves.concat(special_moves(board))

  moves
end
```

Next, in our move logic, check if the piece is a King or a Pawn, and if so, check if the move is a special move:

```ruby
if (piece.is_a?(King) || piece.is_a?(Pawn)) && piece.special_moves(board).include?(move)
  # Perform the special move (castling or en passant)
elsif piece.possible_moves(board).include?(move)
  # Perform the regular move
else
  # Raise an error
end
```
